### Introduction
In this project I needed to write my algorithm in order to create a player to fight other students on the Filler board. <br />
### Concept
Two players gain points by placing on a board, one after the other, tha game piece obtained byt the game master (virtual machine). <br />
The game ends when the game piece cannot be placed anymore. <br />
Wins those player, who placed more pieces than the other.
